Try the demo [http://shannap.com/mindspace-demo]

You can add Text Node or Image Node to the canvas, and export the whole mind map to json. It does not support local or server saving now, so if you'd like to use it as your mind map tool, please copy the json string from the graph textarea and save it by yourself.
